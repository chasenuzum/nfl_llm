# NFL Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze NFL (National Football League) data from the year 2008 using Python. The project involves processing, analyzing, and visualizing various aspects of NFL data to derive insights and patterns.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing and cleaning the NFL data to make it suitable for analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducting statistical tests and calculations to gain deeper insights into the data.
- **Visualization:** Creating informative visualizations such as plots, charts, and graphs to illustrate findings.
- **Predictive Modeling (Optional):** Implementing machine learning models to predict outcomes or trends based on historical NFL data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Langchain
- Chromadb

## Installation
